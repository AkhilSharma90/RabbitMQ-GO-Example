# Work Queues

The main idea behind Work Queues (aka: Task Queues) is to avoid doing a resource-intensive task immediately and having to wait for it to complete. Instead we schedule the task to be done later. We encapsulate a task as a message and send it to a queue. A worker process running in the background will pop the tasks and eventually execute the job. When you run many workers the tasks will be shared between them.

This concept is especially useful in web applications where it's impossible to handle a complex task during a short HTTP request window.

## Round-robin dispatching
One of the advantages of using a Task Queue is the ability to easily parallelise work. If we are building up a backlog of work, we can just add more workers and that way, scale easily.

By default, RabbitMQ will send each message to the next consumer, in sequence. On average every consumer will get the same number of messages. This way of distributing messages is called round-robin. Try this out with three or more workers.

## Message acknowledgment

Doing a task can take a few seconds, you may wonder what happens if a consumer starts a long task and it terminates before it completes. With our current code, once RabbitMQ delivers a message to the consumer, it immediately marks it for deletion. In this case, if you terminate a worker, the message it was just processing is lost. The messages that were dispatched to this particular worker but were not yet handled are also lost.

But we don't want to lose any tasks. If a worker dies, we'd like the task to be delivered to another worker.

In order to make sure a message is never lost, RabbitMQ supports message acknowledgments. An ack(nowledgement) is sent back by the consumer to tell RabbitMQ that a particular message has been received, processed and that RabbitMQ is free to delete it.

If a consumer dies (its channel is closed, connection is closed, or TCP connection is lost) without sending an ack, RabbitMQ will understand that a message wasn't processed fully and will re-queue it. If there are other consumers online at the same time, it will then quickly redeliver it to another consumer. That way you can be sure that no message is lost, even if the workers occasionally die.

A timeout (30 minutes by default) is enforced on consumer delivery acknowledgement. This helps detect buggy (stuck) consumers that never acknowledge deliveries. You can increase this timeout as described in Delivery Acknowledgement Timeout - https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html#acknowledgement-timeout .

In this tutorial we will use manual message acknowledgements by passing a false for the "auto-ack" argument and then send a proper acknowledgment from the worker with d.Ack(false) (this acknowledges a single delivery), once we're done with a task.

```
msgs, err := ch.Consume(
  q.Name, // queue
  "",     // consumer
  false,  // auto-ack
  false,  // exclusive
  false,  // no-local
  false,  // no-wait
  nil,    // args
)
```

Acknowledgement must be sent on the same channel that received the delivery. Attempts to acknowledge using a different channel will result in a channel-level protocol exception. See the doc guide on confirmations to learn more.


## Forgotten acknowledgment
It's a common mistake to miss the ack. It's an easy error, but the consequences are serious. Messages will be redelivered when your client quits (which may look like random redelivery), but RabbitMQ will eat more and more memory as it won't be able to release any unacked messages.

In order to debug this kind of mistake you can use rabbitmqctl to print the messages_unacknowledged field:

```
sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
```

On Windows, drop the sudo:

```
rabbitmqctl.bat list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
```

## Message durability
We have learned how to make sure that even if the consumer dies, the task isn't lost. But our tasks will still be lost if RabbitMQ server stops.

When RabbitMQ quits or crashes it will forget the queues and messages unless you tell it not to. Two things are required to make sure that messages aren't lost: we need to mark both the queue and messages as durable.

First, we need to make sure that the queue will survive a RabbitMQ node restart. In order to do so, we need to declare it as durable:

``` 
q, err := ch.QueueDeclare(
  "task_queue",      // name
  true,         // durable
  false,        // delete when unused
  false,        // exclusive
  false,        // no-wait
  nil,          // arguments
)
```
This `durable` option change needs to be applied to both the producer and consumer code.

## Note on message persistence
At this point we're sure that the task_queue queue won't be lost even if RabbitMQ restarts. Now we need to mark our messages as persistent - by using the `amqp.Persistent`` option `amqp.Publishing` takes.

Marking messages as persistent doesn't fully guarantee that a message won't be lost. Although it tells RabbitMQ to save the message to disk, there is still a short time window when RabbitMQ has accepted a message and hasn't saved it yet. Also, RabbitMQ doesn't do fsync(2) for every message -- it may be just saved to cache and not really written to the disk. The persistence guarantees aren't strong, but it's more than enough for our simple task queue. If you need a stronger guarantee then you can use publisher confirms.

```
err = ch.PublishWithContext(ctx,
  "",           // exchange
  q.Name,       // routing key
  false,        // mandatory
  false,
  amqp.Publishing {
    DeliveryMode: amqp.Persistent,
    ContentType:  "text/plain",
    Body:         []byte(body),
})
```

## Fair dispatch

You might have noticed that the dispatching still doesn't work exactly as we want. For example in a situation with two workers, when all odd messages are heavy and even messages are light, one worker will be constantly busy and the other one will do hardly any work. Well, RabbitMQ doesn't know anything about that and will still dispatch messages evenly.

This happens because RabbitMQ just dispatches a message when the message enters the queue. It doesn't look at the number of unacknowledged messages for a consumer. It just blindly dispatches every n-th message to the n-th consumer.

In order to defeat that we can set the prefetch count with the value of 1. This tells RabbitMQ not to give more than one message to a worker at a time. Or, in other words, don't dispatch a new message to a worker until it has processed and acknowledged the previous one. Instead, it will dispatch it to the next worker that is not still busy.

```
err = ch.Qos(
  1,     // prefetch count
  0,     // prefetch size
  false, // global
)
```

### Note about queue size

If all the workers are busy, your queue can fill up. You will want to keep an eye on that, and maybe add more workers, or have some other strategy.

## `Using message acknowledgments and prefetch count you can set up a work queue. The durability options let the tasks survive even if RabbitMQ is restarted.`
